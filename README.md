# sshx 🔐

A secure SSH identity manager written in Rust.

`sshx` helps developers generate, store, and manage SSH keys with encrypted private key storage using Argon2 and AES-256-GCM.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔑 Generate Ed25519 SSH key pairs
- 🔐 Encrypt private keys with a master password
- 🛡️ Argon2 password-based key derivation
- 🔒 AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- 📂 Secure local vault storage
- 📋 List all stored identities
- 📤 Retrieve public and private keys
- 🗑️ Delete stored identities
- 👀 Hidden password input in terminal

##📦 Installation

Install from crates.io
cargo install sshx
Build from source
git clone https://github.com/mscode07/sshx.git
cd sshx
cargo build --release

Binary will be available at:

target/release/sshx

## 🚀 Usage
Generate a new SSH identity
sshx generate --name github

You will be prompted for a master password. The private key will be encrypted before being stored.

List stored identities
sshx list

Example output:

Stored keys:

- github
- server
Get public key
sshx get github --public
Get private key
sshx get github

You will be prompted for your master password before the private key is decrypted.

Delete an identity
sshx delete github
🔐 Security Model

Private keys are never stored in plaintext.

Encryption Process
User enters a master password
Argon2 derives a 256-bit encryption key
A random salt is generated
A random nonce is generated
Private key is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
Encrypted data is stored locally
Storage Format
salt:nonce:ciphertext
Vault Location
~/.sshx/vault/

Example:

~/.sshx/vault/
├── github
├── github.pub
├── server
└── server.pub

💼 Why This Project Matters

sshx demonstrates:

Systems programming in Rust
Cryptography and secure key management
Filesystem persistence
Modular software architecture
CLI application design

This project was built as a production-style tool rather than a toy project.
